Hi, I'm Nick. 


I have worked in operational and technical service management roles for over 20 years and have extensive experience and knowledge of Marketing Technology, Supply Chain Management, Operational Management and Business Implementation.

My current role centers on day to day Technical, Operational and Project Management, Business Analysis, Client Relationship/Technical Account Management and HSEQ&S Management (Incorporating ISO 9001, ISO 14001, OHAS 18001 and ISO 27001). I read code, but until recently havent really written it.  All thats changing now as I'm buildning on my Python and c++ knowledge

I provide a "one stop shop" for clients: easing them through the implementation journey, from initial scoping, through business and technical analysis managing and supporting the development process though to test and relase and provinding ongoing support.
